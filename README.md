# Web winamp

Remember the old good times when you used to listen to the legendary songs on your windows 95 using winamp? Well those times arent back, but we can pretend that this is the case thank to **WEB WINAMP 9999**. You can use winamp anytime and anywhere, all you need is a web browser and a little bit of internet connection :flushed:.

## Project structure

The repository consists of two folders:

**[Client](/client)** - A Vue3 app with Composition API responsible for UI of this masterpiece.

**[Server](/server/)** - An Express app that provides streaming service to our Client, which is a masterpiece (I am not sure if I have mentioned it).

## Cool, but how do I launch this project locally?

I dont know yet, but we will manage to do it. Atleast I hope we will...

<sub>Ok, I know this project is not a masterpiece, but what if we could make it a masterpiece together? If you see something that is heresy, feel to free to raise issue or contact me someway :D</sub>
